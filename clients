Before creating a parser, figure out how to parse stream using Node



Genium deserialize algorithm
	Parse int into messageKey
	Determine message type based on messageKey


length of binary messages is specified by msg len field


Genium binary
	short - length
	byte - soup type

Reading stream
	binary file client
		No need to login

		No need to maintain tcp connection w heartbeats

		binary files only contain sequenced messages

	Realtime stream
		Includes both sequenced and other message types

		Must login 

		Must maintain soup connection via heartbeats
